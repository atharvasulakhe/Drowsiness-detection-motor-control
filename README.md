In this paper, we implemented an analysis of P, PI and PID controllers using MATLAB software and concluded that PID controller is better than the others. We also constructed an Arduino-based hardware using a motor driver to control the speed of the DC motor. Finally, we used this concept to innovate a solution to reduce car crashes due to driver drowsiness wherein a python-based algorithm would detect the alertness level of the driver and if it is below a certain threshold, the speed of the motor will automatically be reduced and risk of accidents will be minimized, thus enhancing road safety.
